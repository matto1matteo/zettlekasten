# A `man` to rule them all

`man` is the command to read command documentation when provided. It uses a
pager programm (like `less`) to show documentation. If u want to read a
particular section/page (still have to figure out the nomenclature), use 

```bash
$ man <page number/section number> name of the command
```

This section/page number can be found inside man of the same or different
command with the following notation:

```bash
<programm name>(<section/page number>)
```
