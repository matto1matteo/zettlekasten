# Packages

In Go an application is organized in packages. A package is a collection of 
source files located in the same folder.

Go determines if an item can be called by code in other packages through how it
is declared. To make a function, type, variable, constant or struct field 
externally visible (known as exported) the name must start with a capital 
letter.
