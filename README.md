# Zettlekasten

In this repository I will store bits of my knoledge using the
[Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) paradigm.

Each subdirctory is basically a "kasten" from the german chest, basically
holding informations based on the timestamp in which they are "produced".

Any "zettle", aka note, inside a kasten is identified by a title and contains
just a little piece of information regarding a specific topic.

We the help of git and git related techonologies, like git grep (grep alone is
enough) and git servise like github, we can easily search for knowledge.

Writing those notes in markdown, with the help of pandoc, makes easy to
compose these informations into helpful knoledge.
