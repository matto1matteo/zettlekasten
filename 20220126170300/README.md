# Delete a branch

## Local branch

To delete a local branch

```bash
$ git branch -D branch-name # -D equivalent to --delete
```

## Remote branch

To delete a remote branch, we simply "push" a delete command

```bash
$ git push --delete remote-name branch-name # don't remember if -D is allowed
> here
```
