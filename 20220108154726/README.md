# Linux philosophy

Do one thing good, and make sure it will integrate well with other things.

## Plus monolith

Use one command and associate multiple subcommands, this is possible now that we
have a huge amount of ram

But this still go good with the philosophy. A good example is vim, tiny editor
with a huge ecosystem of plugins and command line tools made available through 
command mode.
