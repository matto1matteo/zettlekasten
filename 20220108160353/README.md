# GPL vs BSD

Basically GPL is intended for software that claims free to use ease, meaning
everything that statically links to a GPLed software must use a GPL license,
thus preventing the newer one to be sold.

In the other hand

> The BSD license is intended to encourage product commercialization.

Thus is possible to use BSD code in GPL-licensed software, but not the reverse.

# MIT

MIT license is super similar to BSD (2), meaning it's possible to redistribute,
even by selling copies, and modify software without given warranty.
